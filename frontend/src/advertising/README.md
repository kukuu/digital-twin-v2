# Advertising README

To implement this solution:

1. Create the advertising page at /app/advertising/page.js with the component code provided

2. Create the CSS file at /app/advertising/Advertising.css

3. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

i. @paypal/react-paypal-js for PayPal integration

ii. react-hook-form for form handling

4. Update your next.config.js to include PayPal domains if needed:
```
 module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['www.paypal.com'],
  },
}

```
5. The link to this page already exists in your main app at:

6. The advertising page features:

i. Responsive two-row layout for image and video ads

ii. Radio button selection for different ad durations

iii. Credit card form with validation

iv. PayPal integration

v. Authentication handling (users must be signed in to pay)

vi. Error handling and validation


## Layout improvement and adding Time Series Graph

### Key Improvements:

1. New Meter Grid Layout:

2. Each meter appears in its own row with card + graph

3. Clean visual hierarchy

4. Automatic stacking for additional meters

### Time-Series Visualization:

1. Interactive charts showing last 20 readings

2. Real-time updates via socket.io

3. Clean, minimal design that doesn't overwhelm

### Enhanced Responsiveness:

1. Stacks elements vertically on mobile

2. Maintains side-by-side layout on desktop

3. Flexible card and graph sizing

### Performance Optimizations:

1. Only stores last 20 readings in memory

2. Memoized components prevent unnecessary re-renders

3. Efficient chart updates

### Visual Consistency:

1. Unified color scheme

2. Consistent spacing and shadows

3. Clear visual hierarchy

### To implement this:

1. Install Chart.js: npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2

2. Replace your existing App.js and App.css

3. Ensure your backend emits timestamps with readings


### Conclusion:

The layout will automatically handle any number of meters by creating new rows, with each meter's usage graph displayed adjacent to its card.

## Updating USER READINGS dynamically across all METER Grids:

### This implementation:

1. Replaces the "Please Enter your reading!" text with a form containing:

2. A number input field with default placeholder text

3. A calculate button

### When the form is submitted:

1. Takes the user's meter reading value

2. Calculates costs for all energy providers using their tariffs

3. Displays the results in a styled table

4. The table:

5. Has headers "Energy Company" and "Total Cost"

6. Shows each supplier and the calculated cost

7. Has alternating row colors for better readability

### Includes a close button that:

1. Removes the results from view when clicked

2. Allows the user to perform new calculations

### Key changes made
