This Python script performs data preprocessing on a synthetic energy dataset, focusing on handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, followed by imputation and restructuring of the dataset. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

**Import Libraries:**

i. pandas and numpy are used for data manipulation.

ii. KNNImputer from sklearn is used for imputing missing values.

iii. generate_energy_dataset is a custom function that generates a synthetic energy dataset.

**Generate Dataset:**

i. The generate_energy_dataset function is called to create a DataFrame (df) with energy meter readings and a timestamp column (Datetime).

ii. Handle Missing Timestamps:

iii. Rows with missing timestamps are dropped using dropna().

**Sort Data:**

i. The DataFrame is sorted by the Datetime column to ensure chronological order.

ii. Remove Duplicates:

iii. Duplicate rows based on Datetime and meter readings are identified, and their meter readings are set to NaN (missing values).

**Detect and Handle Outliers:**

i. Outliers in the meter readings are identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

ii. Values below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR are considered outliers and replaced with NaN.

**Impute Missing Values:**

i. Missing values in the meter readings are imputed using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation.

ii. The imputed values are stored in a new DataFrame (data_imputed).

**Restructure DataFrame:**

i. The original meter reading columns with NAN values are dropped, and the imputed values are concatenated with the remaining columns.

ii. The Datetime column is set as the index, and the columns are reordered for better readability.

**Key Output:**
The final DataFrame (new_df) contains cleaned, imputed, and restructured energy meter data, ready for analysis or modeling.

Analysis of the Python Code for Synthetic Energy Data Generation
This Python code generates a synthetic dataset simulating electricity meter readings with various realistic anomalies and patterns. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Key Components
**Imports:**

i. pandas: For data manipulation and DataFrame creation

ii. numpy: For random number generation and numerical operations

iii. datetime: For handling date/time operations

iv. plotly.express: For visualization (though not used in this snippet)

### 2. Core Functions

i. generate_single_reading(hour, day)

a. This function creates a single meter reading based on:

b. A base reading of 20 units

ii. Time-based variations:

a. Daytime (10am-9pm): Higher readings

b. Weekends: +3 to 8 units randomly

c. Weekdays: +3 to 6 units randomly

d. Nighttime: Lower readings (-3 to +2 units randomly)

iii. generate_energy_dataset(start_date, period, _id, datetime_index)

The main function that generates a complete synthetic dataset with realistic anomalies.

### 3 Dataset Generation Process

1. Time Setup:

i. Creates hourly timestamps from start_date to start_date + period hours

ii. For each hour:

a. Basic Reading Generation:

i. Creates readings for 3 meters (A, B, C) using generate_single_reading()

ii. Each meter has a unique ID (incrementing from the provided _id)

iii. Realistic Anomalies:

a. System Failures (0.5% chance): Duplicates previous reading

b. Data Transmission Failures (5% chance per meter): Sets reading to NaN

c. Outliers (<1% chance): Adds large spikes/dips (±15 or ±20) to random meters

iv. Extended Anomalies:

a. Load Shedding: Periods of 0 consumption (4-8 hours or 3-5 days)

b. Meter Tampering: Constant unusual readings (20-22 units) for 3-5 days

### Data Collection:

i. All readings are collected in updated_data list

Finally converted to a pandas DataFrame

Output Options:
Can return DataFrame with datetime as index or as a separate column

### 4. Purpose and Characteristics

This code simulates real-world energy meter data with:

i. Time-based patterns: Higher usage during daytime, especially weekends

ii. Common data issues:

iii. Missing data (NaN values)

iv. Duplicate readings

v. Extreme outliers

vi. Real-world scenarios:

vii. Meter tampering

viii. Power outages (load shedding)

ix. Sensor failures

x. The synthetic data would be useful for:

a. Testing anomaly detection algorithms

b. Developing forecasting models

c. Creating data visualization examples

d. Evaluating data cleaning pipelines

The carefully designed probabilities and patterns make the synthetic data realistically unpredictable while maintaining underlying patterns that mimic actual energy consumption behavior.


## Vocabulary

### Imputation: 
Imputation is a data preprocessing technique used to handle missing values in a dataset. Missing data can occur due to various reasons, such as errors in data collection, sensor malfunctions, or incomplete records. Imputation involves replacing these missing values with estimated or calculated values to ensure the dataset is complete and suitable for analysis or modeling.



**Common Imputation Methods:**

1. Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:

Replace missing values with the mean (for numerical data), median (for skewed data), or mode (for categorical data) of the column.

Example: If a column has missing values, they can be replaced with the average value of that column.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:

Replace missing values with the average of the nearest neighbors (similar rows) in the dataset.

Example: If a row has a missing value, the algorithm finds the most similar rows (based on other features) and uses their values to fill in the missing data.

3. Forward/Backward Fill:

Replace missing values with the previous (forward fill) or next (backward fill) value in the dataset.

Commonly used in time-series data.

Example: If a sensor reading is missing at 10:00 AM, it can be filled with the reading from 9:00 AM (forward fill).

4. Interpolation:

Estimate missing values based on the trend or pattern of the data.

Example: Linear interpolation estimates missing values by drawing a straight line between known data points.

5. Predictive Modeling:

Use machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees) to predict missing values based on other features in the dataset.

Example: A regression model can predict a missing temperature value based on humidity, time of day, and location.

6. Constant Value Imputation:

Replace missing values with a constant (e.g., 0, -1, or a specific category like "Unknown").

Example: Missing values in a "Gender" column can be replaced with "Unknown."

**Why Imputation is Important:**
Maintains Dataset Integrity: Ensures the dataset is complete and usable for analysis or modeling.

Improves Model Performance: Many machine learning algorithms cannot handle missing values, so imputation ensures they work correctly.

Preserves Data Relationships: Advanced methods like KNN or predictive modeling maintain the relationships between features.

Example:
If a dataset has missing values in the "Age" column:

Mean Imputation: Replace missing ages with the average age of the dataset.

KNN Imputation: Replace missing ages with the average age of the most similar individuals (based on other features like income, education, etc.).

**In the provided Python code, KNNImputer is used to impute missing meter readings by considering the values of the nearest neighbors, ensuring the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.**

### ETL

 ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) dependencies and processes for a Fullstack application would involve integrating data from multiple sources (e.g., user interactions, third-party APIs, and internal databases) to support analytics, personalization, and operational efficiency. 

Key dependencies include data extraction tools (e.g., Apache Kafka for real-time streaming or Python scripts for batch processing), transformation frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark or Pandas for data cleaning and enrichment), and loading mechanisms into a centralized data warehouse (e.g., Google BigQuery, Snowflake, or Amazon Redshift). Orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect would manage the ETL workflows, ensuring scalability and reliability.

The process would begin with extracting raw data from say a mobile app events (tracked via tools like Firebase Analytics or Amplitude) and external APIs. Data would then be transformed to ensure consistency, remove duplicates, and enrich it with additional context (e.g., user demographics or behavioral insights). 

Finally, the processed data would be loaded into a data warehouse for querying and analysis. This ETL pipeline would enable real-time insights, A/B testing, and personalized user experiences, aligning with the job’s focus on scalability, data-driven decision-making, and delivering high-quality products. Monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog or Prometheus) would ensure pipeline reliability, while data governance practices would maintain compliance and data quality.


### Outlier:
 Adds large spikes/dips to random meters.

### Load Shedding:
 Periods of 0 consumption 

### Tempered Value:
Constant unusual readings 

### Duplicate 
Occurs during system failures and duplicates previous reading

### Null Value (As used in data generation):
