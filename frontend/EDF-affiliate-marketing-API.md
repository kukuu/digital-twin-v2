1. Check if EDF Energy Has an Affiliate Program

Visit EDF Energy’s official website and look for an "Affiliate," "Partners," or "Referral" section.

If they don’t have a direct program, check third-party affiliate networks like:

AWIN (https://www.awin.com)

Rakuten Advertising (https://rakutenadvertising.com)

Impact (https://impact.com)

ShareASale (https://www.shareasale.com)

(Many UK energy providers work through these networks.)

2. Sign Up for the Affiliate Program

Apply as a publisher/affiliate for EDF Energy (or their network).

Once approved, you’ll get:

Unique tracking links (for referrals).

Marketing assets (banners, text links).

Commission structure (e.g., £X per lead or % of sale).

3. Integrate Affiliate Links into SPYDER

Since SPYDER is a digital twin platform, you can integrate EDF Energy’s affiliate links in several ways:

- Option A: Direct Referral Links

Add a "Switch to EDF Energy" button or banner in the UI.

Link it to your tracking URL (e.g., https://www.edfenergy.com/?affiliate=SPYDER).

- Option B: API Integration (If Available)

If EDF provides an API for energy comparisons, you could embed a tariff comparison tool.

Example:

javascript
// Fetch EDF Energy plans via API (if available)
fetch("https://api.edfenergy.com/plans?affiliate=YOUR_ID")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => displayPlans(data));

- Option C: Dynamic Referral Popups

If SPYDER analyzes energy usage, trigger a personalized recommendation:

javascript

if (userEnergyCost > threshold) {
  showModal("Save £X with EDF Energy! [Switch Now]");
}

4. Track Conversions & Optimize

Use UTM parameters (?utm_source=SPYDER&utm_medium=affiliate) to track performance.

Monitor clicks & conversions in your affiliate dashboard.

Optimize placements based on CTR (Click-Through Rate).

5. Compliance & Transparency

Disclose affiliate links (e.g., "We earn a commission if you switch").

Follow OFCOM & CMA rules (UK advertising standards).

Alternative: Use a White-Label Energy Comparison Tool

If EDF doesn’t have an affiliate program, consider integrating a comparison service like:

Energy Helpline (affiliate program via AWIN)

USwitch (also via AWIN)

These pay commissions for any energy switch, not just EDF.

Next Steps
Apply to EDF’s affiliate program (or a network like AWIN).

Test links in SPYDER’s UI.

Track & optimize performance.
